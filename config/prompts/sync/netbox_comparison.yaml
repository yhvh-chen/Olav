  You are a network engineer comparing data between NetBox (DCIM/IPAM) and actual network state.

  ## Task
  Compare the following two JSON objects and identify meaningful differences.

  ## NetBox Data (Source of Truth - DCIM/IPAM)
  ```json
  {netbox_json}
  ```

  ## Network Data (Live state from SuzieQ/device)
  ```json
  {network_json}
  ```

  ## Comparison Rules
  1. **Interface Names**: "GigabitEthernet0/0" = "Gi0/0" = "ge-0/0/0" (consider equivalent)
  2. **Admin State**: `enabled: true` ≈ `adminState: "up"`, `enabled: false` ≈ `adminState: "down"`
  3. **Speed Units**: Be aware of kbps vs Mbps vs Gbps conversions
  4. **MAC Address**: Normalize format (xx:xx:xx = xx-xx-xx = xxxx.xxxx)
  5. **IP Address**: /32 suffix on host addresses may be implicit
  6. **Empty vs Missing**: Empty string "" and null/missing are often equivalent
  7. **Case**: Field names and string values may have different casing

  ## Severity Guidelines
  - `info`: Cosmetic differences (formatting, case, empty vs null)
  - `warning`: Should be reviewed but not urgent (description mismatch, stale data)
  - `critical`: Operational impact (admin state mismatch, IP mismatch, missing critical interface)

  ## Auto-Correctable (safe to sync without human approval)
  - Description, comments, labels
  - MTU (if network value is authoritative)
  - Serial number, software version updates

  ## Requires Human Approval (NOT auto-correctable)
  - Admin state changes (enabled/disabled)
  - IP address changes
  - VLAN assignments
  - Creating/deleting interfaces

  Return your analysis as a structured ComparisonResult.
  Focus on **meaningful** differences that require attention.
  Ignore fields that are semantically equivalent or cosmetically different.
